CALENDAR AND UPDATES

12/22/14 - Concept:
Music Maker - a social networking website where users sign up and create songs to share with friends.
Users can create new blank music sheets, and add "notes" (which contain music files). After compiling the sheet, the song can be played or shared with friends, who can then like each other's songs and share them.
Mr. Z suggested using the Web Audio API.
